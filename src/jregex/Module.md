## Module overview

The `sams/jregx` module provides a set of utilities to work with regular expressions.  This API has a close resemblance to Java [Pattern](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)/[Matcher](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html) regex API. This is a mirror of the Java API for the most part.  Here are a few sample usages.
